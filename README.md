#Work RPG (tentative title)

Webapp backend for an idea on how to reward work.  Using an RPG like system of giving
experience and leveling up people for their roles (or classes) based on accomplishments
during their work.

##Technical stuff

Written (to start) to use Flask and Mongo.  It will provide a RESTful API to handle
the actions involved with handling tracking and rewarding players.

##Setup

(TODO: expand this)
Use virtualenv (it is such a good thing to do)
```
mkvirtualenv onpeak-rpg
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
