# Players

Players are the unit that actually participate.  They are what tracks the changes
in experience, leveling, etc.  Players are the main action origin of the system,
they are what perform quests, get items, accumulate exp.  The users log in to
manage their player(s).

## Properties

Players will have properties for their class(es), a counter for their total exp,
a log of their quests, an inventory and track what of that inventory is equiped.
The player model will need to track all of these things (and more as features and
concepts get added/implemented).

(those marked with a ^ are controlled by the server via other calls)
