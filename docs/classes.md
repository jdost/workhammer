# Classes

Classes are specializations the player builds up.  The player can then focus on one
class or spread the work across multiple classes.

## Leveling

Quests can either give experience directly to a class (so the 'UI Polishing' Quest
could give 10 XP to the Frontend Developer) or give experience to the player's
experience pool (so the 'Complete Project' Quest could give 10 XP to the pool).
The experience in the pool does not factor into anything, it is just a holding place
that the User that controls the player can allocate to different classes.
