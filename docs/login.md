# Login System

The login system is the stuff that entails logging in/out and registering.

## Permissions

So every user should have specific permissions, the two main scenarios would be:
* The 'admin' performs actions in regards to other players such as giving exp,
  items, etc.  Admins should be the only ones who can reward players.
* The 'player' who is really just able to see their current player (the former is
  the user whose only permission is their player) and manage them.  They will be
  able to change classes, change the name, mess with items and appearance.
