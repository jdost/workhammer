# Ideas

This is where to keep track of ideas (both long term and short term).

## Items/Inventory

Would require routes for item CRUD, an inventory array for each player, the ability
to "equip" items, applying the effects of the equiped items on effected areas,
being able to add items as a reward.

## Sounds

Probably would want to have this conditionally wrapped with a menu listing, have a
sound played on every button/submit/anchor click.  Sound should be very short, 
probably use a MIDI (true 8bit).

## Graphics

A logo is going to be done soon.  Eventually would be nice to write a graphical 
system to give some visual of the Player.  Would probably pick the avatar based on
the highest level class.  Could use this for a little portrait as well.
