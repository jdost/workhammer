# ITRPG

So the idea for this application came from my boss (@nagash77).  He proposed having
an RPG like system for IT employees, where they would gain experience for doing
various things and level up based on these.  These docs will (hopefully) outline
and explain the goals of the project and document the various parts of the
functionality.
